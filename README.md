# HR Analytics Strategy

This project focuses on analyzing Human Resources (HR) data to uncover trends and patterns that can drive strategic decisions in employee retention, hiring, and workforce planning. The goal is to assist organizations in leveraging data for proactive HR management.

## 📊 Objective

To explore HR-related data and build strategic insights that help in:
- Identifying factors influencing employee attrition
- Understanding workforce composition
- Recommending data-driven solutions to improve employee engagement and retention

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains anonymized employee data including:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Education, etc.)
- Job-related details (Department, Salary, Job Satisfaction, etc.)
- Performance metrics and attrition status

Dataset Source: [Kaggle - HR Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data wrangling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Predictive modeling
- **Power BI / Tableau (Optional)** – Interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and data types
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Normalized numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized employee distributions by department, age, and attrition status
   - Analyzed correlations between factors like satisfaction, workload, and attrition

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Applied classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

4. **Strategic Insights**
   - Identified key drivers of employee turnover
   - Suggested improvements to HR policies and practices

## ✅ Results

- Discovered that job satisfaction, salary hike percentage, and overtime frequency significantly influence attrition.
- Achieved ~85% accuracy with the Random Forest model for attrition prediction.
- Presented actionable recommendations for HR teams to reduce employee churn.

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Built a full-cycle analytics project from data cleaning to strategy formulation.
- Learned how to translate insights into actionable business recommendations.
- Strengthened understanding of HR KPIs and predictive modeling.
